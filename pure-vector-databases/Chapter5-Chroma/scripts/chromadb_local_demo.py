# Step 1: Import ChromaDB
import chromadb
from chromadb.config import Settings

# Step 2: Create a ChromaDB client
# Using ephemeral client for this demo (in-memory storage)
client = chromadb.Client()

# For persistent storage, use:
# client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="./chromadb_data")

# Step 3: Create or get a collection
collection_name = "movie_reviews"

# Delete collection if it exists (for clean demo)
try:
    client.delete_collection(collection_name)
except:
    pass  # Collection doesn't exist

# Create collection with automatic embedding

    name=collection_name,

# Step 4: Sample movie review data
reviews = [
    "Amazing action sequences and stunning visual effects make this superhero movie a must-watch.",
    "A heartwarming romantic comedy that will make you laugh and cry at the same time.",
    "This documentary about wildlife conservation is both educational and deeply moving.",
    "Brilliant sci-fi thriller with mind-bending plot twists and excellent acting.",
    "Family-friendly animated film with beautiful animation and memorable characters.",
    "Intense psychological drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat.",
    "Epic fantasy adventure with incredible world-building and magical creatures.",
    "True crime series that uncovers shocking revelations about a cold case."

# ChromaDB will automatically generate embeddings
